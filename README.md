I have completed all the 3 tasks. I spent 4hrs 40mins for developing the create 'Registration form task'.
Also, I request you to note that I have used create-react=app cli version for quick setup, 
Prerequest nodejs must be installed in your local machine in order to run the development enviornment.

steps to be followed:
1. git clone https://github.com/sajankumar/smavatask_sajankumarvijayan.git
2.  cd smavatask_sajankumarvijayan/creative
3. npm install
4.  npm start for development env
5.  npm run build for production 

You can find my source code under creative/src/components

Note: I have uploaded this creative registration form task for quick demo in my website http://sajankumarvijayan.com/task/build/
